# SDA-Flow (Under heavy development)

![GitHub package.json version](https://img.shields.io/github/package-json/v/nshiab/simple-data-analysis-flow)

Welcome on the open source project Simple Data Analysis Flow!

I created SDA-Flow to allow non-coders to use another open source project of mine - [simple-data-analysis.js](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis) - without code.

If you use this project, show off your work and tag me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/NaelShiab) or [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/naelshiab/)!

Feel to start a conversation, raise an issue or contribute to the code. :)
