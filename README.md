# Simple Data Analysis Flow

SDA-Flow is a node-based editor for [simple-data-analysis](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis), an easy-to-use and high-performance JavaScript library for data analysis.

This repo and the SDA library are maintained by [Nael Shiab](http://naelshiab.com/), computational journalist and senior data producer for [CBC News](https://www.cbc.ca/news).

To use the editor, [click here](https://nshiab.github.io/simple-data-analysis-flow/).

Everything runs in your browser. The data doesn't leave your computer.

Not all [SDA methods](https://nshiab.github.io/simple-data-analysis/classes/SimpleWebTable.html) are implemented. If you need one, [create an issue](https://github.com/nshiab/simple-data-analysis-flow/issues).
